"Decision Tree ISDA 140" is a  Jupyter Notebook project using decision tree classification with the Wine dataset. Built for ISDA 140 coursework, this project explores model accuracy based on varying min_samples_split values using scikit-learn. Includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree.
